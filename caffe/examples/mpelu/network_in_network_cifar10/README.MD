# Comparison of activation functions on the CIFAR10

# Dataset
The experiments are performed on the preprocessed `cifar10` dataset which can be downloaded from [Model Zoo](https://gist.github.com/mavenlin/e56253735ef32c3c296d)

# Usage:
Run `train.sh` in the `CAFFE_ROOT`. For example:

```
$ examples/mpelu/network_in_network_cifar10/train.sh
```

This script will run each experiment 5 times and store the outputs in time-related folders.
